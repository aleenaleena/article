        LONDON — They were wrapped in plain brown paper and addressed to “the librarian” at the University of Cambridge.<br><br>The delivery took place circa 1910. Sent by a major figure of the suffragist movement in Britain, Marion Phillips, the parcel
        contained posters illustrating the struggles of women in the country to get the right to vote.<br><br>It took decades for the posters on fading paper to be rediscovered and dusted off. But the images illustrating women’s fight for voting rights
        have gone on display for the first time at the university to commemorate the Representation of the People Act of 1918, which gave British women over the age of 30 the right to vote 100 years ago on Tuesday.<br><br> The institution bills the posters
        as “one of the largest surviving collections of suffrage posters from the early 20th century.”<br><br> “These posters are fantastic examples of the suffrage publicity machine of the early 20th century,” Chris Burgess, the exhibitions officer at
        the university’s library, says on the exhibition’s website.<br><br> “They were created to be plastered on walls, torn down by weather or political opponents, so it is highly unusual for this material to be safely stored for over a hundred years.”<br><br>Women
        such as Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst campaigned for the right to vote for all. The movement was split into labels: suffragists and suffragettes, whose members took a harder stance, staging loud protests, smashing windows and
        the like.<br><br>Mrs. Fawcett considered herself a suffragist, a moderate opposed to the sometimes violent protests of campaigners like Ms. Pankhurst, known as a suffragette.</p>

      <div class="bodytext2">History so far seems to have been relatively kinder to the moderate. Last year, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Mrs. Fawcett would be the first woman to be honored by a statue in Parliament Square in London, where there are 11 statues
        of men — giants like Churchill, Lincoln and Mandela. (A memorial to Ms. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel stands in a corner of the Palace of Westminster in London.)<br><br>In addition, a blue plaque commemorating Mrs. Fawcett was to be unveiled
        at the Cambridge Guildhall on Feb. 6, according to the City Council.
        <br><br> As for Ms. Pankhurst, who helped found the Women’s Social and Political Union, was arrested several times and even went on a hunger strike, The New York Times wrote in 1913: <br><br>“The hysterical women in England who have been followers
        of Mrs. Pankhurst in her defiance of law and decency are now threatening to institute a reign of terror. Mrs. Pankhurst has been convicted as an accessory to the crime of arson and has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment — a mild sentence.<br><br>The
        behavior of the trial Judge and the latitude accorded to the prisoner, who was permitted to conduct her own defense, seemed unaccountable on this side of the Atlantic, where we are inclined to boast of our liberty. The court seemed to be afraid
        of the prisoner, as, indeed, the Home Office seems to be afraid of the whole gang of female mischief-makers. We have all been saying that if woman suffrage is to survive in Great Britain, these militants, who represent but a small part of the
        suffrage movement, would surely delay the hour of triumph.”<br><br>But triumph they did.</p>

      of the day. The poster argues that support for the groups should be withdrawn until women could vote.</div>
